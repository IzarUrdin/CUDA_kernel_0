# Is a GPU really more powerfull than a CPU? 

Copied from my question at [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59567162/is-a-gpu-really-more-powerfull-than-a-cpu) on 2nd of January 2020. [closed by CUDA inquisitors]

I have done a test using CUDA with my laptop. Using the CPU (i7 6700HQ) is at least 20 times more powerful than the 65,000 processors of the GEFORCE 940M inside. While with CUDA it takes about 20 seconds to find 50,000 items over a set of 1 million, the CPU does it in less than 1 second.

What IÂ´m doing wrong? This is the CUDA code (c++):

    __global__ void FindFirst(const int items_count, SomeBasicType* data, long target, int* pFound)
	{						
			for (int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x; i < items_count && *pFound < 0; i += blockDim.x * gridDim.x)
			{				
				if (data[i].Value == target) *pFound = i;
			}
	}

*** EDIT 1: *** 

After a few hours checking what I was doing wrong, the conclusion is that CUDA is limited to work isolated from CPU and it is only efficient for very simple algorithms. Implementing a dictionary in C# is exponentially more efficient than any kernel you can write in CUDA. 

I followed the code of Marc Gravell published [here][1]; adding a new kernel for search and some code to test in main sub. You can get it from my GitHub [CUDA_kernel_0][2].

*** EDIT 2: *** 

Since yesterday I have been investigating and trying to understand what I was doing wrong, and now I can say that my GPU can works 500 times faster than my CPU; but always working alone. Initializing and finalizing a task have a hard cost so tasks must be large enough to compensate for this cost and furthermore they must be carefully coded. The last commit has an example (test_1) of how to check the performance of the GPU against CPU. Have fun :)

*** EDIT 3: ***

Finally, I have fixed some things in the kernel and the result is that GPU is about 10 times faster than my [i7-6700HQ][3] CPU with 8 thread-cores. You can see the output of these results [here][4]. Furthermore, it shows that the GPU GeForce 940M can works only in 32 thread-cores at most.
